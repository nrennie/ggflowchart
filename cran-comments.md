## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs,  or WARNINGs. 

Besides the new submission NOTE, there is one NOTE that is only found on Windows (Server 2022, R-devel 64-bit): 

```
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
```
As noted in [R-hub issue #503](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503), this could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.
